PROCEDURE DuplicateList( List: aList; VAR ListCopy: aList );
(*
  OPERATION:
    Makes a copy of a list.
  NOTE:
    The data pointed to by list entries is not duplicated - just the list
    structure.
    This allows you to have move than one position or ordering to your data
    entries.
    Of course, if you want to maintain this list as a duplicate you will have
    to duplicate all future additions and deletions from list.
    The original list positioning remains unchanged. The copied list is
    positioned similarly.

PROCEDURE FindEntryInList( List: aList; DataPtr: ADDRESS; VAR Found: BOOLEAN );
(*

    Returns Found TRUE if it finds it.
    If Found, list is left positioned at the found entry
    If NOT Found, list is left at end of list
