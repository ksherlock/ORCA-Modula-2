DEFINITION MODULE Storage;
(*
  Standard dynamic storage management

  Storage management for dynamic variables. Calls to the Modula-2 standard
  procedures NEW and DISPOSE are translated into calls to ALLOCATE and
  DEALLOCATE. The standard way to provide these two procedures is to import
  them from this module 'Storage'.

  This module is actually implemented in Storage.ASM, and works as a glue to
  the ORCA Memory Manager Library Routines.

  NOTE:
    If you want to bypass the ORCA Memory Manager, and use the GS Memory 
    Manager, see the module EZStorage which deals directly with the toolbox,
    using the same interface as defined here, but also allowing you to do
    things like allocate stack memory, etc.

FROM SYSTEM IMPORT
  ADDRESS;

PROCEDURE ALLOCATE(VAR a: ADDRESS; size: CARDINAL);
(*
  OPERATION:
    Allocate some dynamic storage (contiguous memory area).

  NOTE:
    The actual number of bytes allocated may be slightly greater than 'size',
    due to administrative overhead.
*)

PROCEDURE DEALLOCATE (VAR a: ADDRESS; size: CARDINAL);
(*
  OPERATION:
    Release some dynamic storage (contiguous memory area).

  NOTE:
    The storage area released is made available for subsequent calls to
    ALLOCATE.

    'a' is set to NIL as a result of the deallocation.
*)

PROCEDURE Available (size: CARDINAL) : BOOLEAN;
(*
  OPERATION:
    Returns TRUE if there exists a block of memory at lease 'size' bytes in
    size.
*)

END Storage.
