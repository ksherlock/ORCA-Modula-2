(*
  OPERATION:
    Uses the GetChar procedure specified in SetUp to read the next "token".
    A token is defined as a string of characters delimited by any of the
    characters given in Delimiters as specified by SetUp.

    In other words, ReadToken reads characters until it finds a character
    not contained in Delimiters. Then reads all subsequent characters into
    Token until it encounters another delimiter.

    Delim is set to the delimiter encountered. If Finish is TRUE or if we
    finished because the Token string filled up, Delim returns 0C.

    If the end of data is encountered, Finish returns TRUE.
  NOTE:
    Must define Get first. Until you do, ReadToken will always return an
    empty string.
    Delimiters defaults to aCHARSet{ EOL } - ie ReadToken will act like a
    read line.
