PROCEDURE InitM2Shell;
(*
  OPERATION:
    This procedure will use the shell call "GetLInfo" to obtain the name of
    the file to be compiled.  It also sets up a number of globals that
    describe the compiling environment:

      For example:

       Do we compile to a disk file or a memory file?
       Whether to generate debug code.
       Whether to invoke the editor when an error is detected.
       Whether to list the source.
       Whether to produce a symbol table.
       Has the name of a makefile been supplied?
*)

PROCEDURE OpenNextObjectFile(isMainModule: BOOLEAN);
(*
  OPERATION:
    Given the keep style supplied in the command line info record, open an
    object file for output.  For more detail, see page 411 or the ORCA/M
    manual.
*)

PROCEDURE ShutdownM2Shell(successfull: BOOLEAN; name: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(*
  OPERATION:
    This procedure sets up and executes a "SetLInfo" shell call in order to
    inform the shell as to what the compiler has achieved.

    The "successfull" parameter indicates whether the compile succeeded 
    without errors or not, and is used in setting up the "SetLInfo" call.

    The "name" parameter is the name of the file that was compiled last.
*)

END M2Shell.
